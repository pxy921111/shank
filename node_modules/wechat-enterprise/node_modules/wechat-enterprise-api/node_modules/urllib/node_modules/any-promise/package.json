The application can register its preferred `Promise` implementation and it will be exported when requiring `any-promise` from library code.\n\nIf no preference is registered, defaults to the global `Promise` for newer Node.js versions. The browser version defaults to the window `Promise`, so polyfill or register as necessary.\n\n### Library Usage\n\nTo use any `Promise` constructor, simply require it:\n\n```javascript\nvar Promise = require('any-promise');\n\nreturn Promise\n  .all([xf, f, init, coll])\n  .then(fn);\n\n\nreturn new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n  try {\n    resolve(item);\n  } catch(e){\n    reject(e);\n  }\n});\n\n```\n\nLibraries using `any-promise` should only use [documented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) functions as there is no guarantee which implementation will be chosen by the application author.  Libraries should never call `register`, only the application user should call if desired.\n\n### Optional Application Registration\n\nAs an application author, you can *optionally* register a preferred `Promise` implementation on application startup (before any call to `require('any-promise')`:\n\n```javascript\nrequire('any-promise/register')('bluebird')\n// -or- require('any-promise/register')('es6-promise')\n// -or- require('any-promise/register')('native-promise-only')\n// -or- require('any-promise/register')('rsvp')\n// -or- require('any-promise/register')('when')\n// -or- require('any-promise/register')('q')\n// -or- require('any-promise/register')('any other ES6 compatible library')\n```\nYou must register your preference before any call to `require('any-promise')` (by you or required packages), and only one implementation can be registered. Typically, this registration would occur at the top of the application entry point.\n\nRegistration is not required for Node.js version >= 0.12 as a native `Promise` implementation is included. If no preference is registered, the global `Promise` will be used.\n\n\n#### Advanced Registration\n\nTo use the browser version, you should either install a polyfill or explicitly register the `Promise` constructor:\n\n```javascript\nrequire('any-promise/register')('bluebird', {Promise: require('bluebird')})\n```\n\nThis could also be used for registering a custom `Promise` implementation or subclass.\n\nYour preference will be registered globally, allowing a single registration even if multiple versions of `any-promise` are installed in the NPM dependency tree or are using multiple bundled JavaScript files in the browser. You can bypass this global registration in options:\n\n\n```javascript\nrequire('../register')('es6-promise', {Promise: require('es6-promise').Promise, global: false})\n```\n\n#### Example:\n\nAssuming `when` is the desired Promise implementation:\n\n```bash\n# Install preferred promise library\n$ npm install when\n# Install any-promise to allow registration\n$ npm install any-promise\n# Install any libraries you would like to use depending on any-promise\n$ npm install mz\n```\nRegister your preference in the application entry point before any other `require` of packages that load `any-promise`:\n\n```javascript\n// top of application index.js or other entry point\nrequire('any-promise/register')('when')\n\n// -or- Equivalent to above in Node.js, but browser version needs polyfill or explicit registration\nrequire('any-promise/register')('when', {Promise: require('when').Promise})\n```\n\nNow that the implementation is registered, you can use any package depending on `any-promise`:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar fsp = require('mz/fs') // mz/fs will use registered `when` promises\nvar Promise = require('any-promise')  // the registered `when.Promise`\n```\n\nIt is safe to call `register` multiple times, but it must always be with the same implementation.\n\nAgain, registration is not required. It should only be called by the application user if overriding the default implementation is desired.\n\n### Advanced Library Usage\n\nIf your library needs to branch code based on the registered implementation, you can retrieve it using `var impl = require('any-promise/implementation')`, where `impl` will be the package name (`\"bluebird\"`, `\"when\"`, etc.) if registered, `\"global.Promise\"` if using the global version on Node.js, or `\"window.Promise\"` if using the browser version. You should always include a default case, as there is no guarantee what package may be registered.\n\n\n### Support for old Node.js versions\n\nNode.js versions prior to `v0.12` may have contained buggy versions of the global `Promise`. For this reason, the global `Promise` is not loaded automatically for these old versions.  If using `any-promise` in Node.js versions versions `<= v0.12`, the user should register a desired implementation.\n\nIf an implementation is not registered, `any-promise` will attempt to discover an installed `Promise` implementation.  If no implementation can be found, an error will be thrown on `require('any-promise')`.  While the auto-discovery usually avoids errors, it is non-deterministic. It is recommended that the user always register a preferred implementation for older Node.js versions.\n\nThis auto-discovery is only available for Node.jS versions prior to `v0.12`. Any newer versions will always default to the global `Promise` implementation.\n",
